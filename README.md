# Election2020

I developed a [website](https://FortyTwoFortyTwo.github.io/Election2020/index.html) for Code Institute's User Centric Frontend Development Project. The website's goal is to explain the United States 2020 election.
There is also a section for the Georgia Senate Runoff and a contact page to sign up for a newsletter.
The website is designed to be simple and easy to use on any platform or scale. There is a tab menu to switch between pages.
